# Analysis of thoraric cancer surgery data

This was a project that I did in the [Decision Making Systems in Medicine](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/sr/fis/karton_predmeta/13E053SOM-2013) class during my undergraduate studies in the summer of 2020.

The goal of the project was to analyze the selected dataset, in my case data from [Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/277/thoracic+surgery+data) and create a classificator both by performing dimensionality reduction
and applying a quadratic classifier, and by training a neural network.
The detailed description of the process is, for now, available in Serbian as a .pdf document (in the form of a project report).
